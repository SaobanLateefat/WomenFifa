## Insights

The first thing we noticed was that the FIFA Women's world cup is held every four years which makes it a quadrennial event.
We went ahead to check the total goals, assists, yellow cards and red cards throughout the years.
Also, we checked the squad per match In which each year can be accessed when the slicer is clicked in the visualization.
In addition, we checked the top 10 squads per total points. You might be wondering how the total point is gotten?
A particular point is assigned to each columns, then multiplied to other columns in other to get the total points e.g., total players = 5%, average age of squads = 10% ... yellow card = -2, red card = -5And there we discovered USA had an overall score of 774.14.
Furthermore, we checked the correlation between Goals and assist by age and discovered there's a linear correlation i.e., the more the assists, the higher chances of a goal.
The possession per minute(90) and discovered that with more possession the match is likely to end quickly as the team would have more goals.
